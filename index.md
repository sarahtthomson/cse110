## Programming
For my major and minor I have a variety of programming experience both related and not related to art.
I have enjoyed learning about different operating systems and the cmd as well.
I have enjoyed making websites in the past with html and css, however am looking forward to using git as it seems pretty intuitive. 
My favorite code to currently write is anything user interactive. Therefor 'String input = keyboard.nextLine()' is one of my favorite functions and lines of code because it allows you to interact in many different ways.
Growing up when I did not have traditional classes to learn programming in school I would take it upon myself to learn programming through my dad who was a computer scientist as well as the website [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).
I am looking forward to using my programming and team work skills in this class in order to take my work to the next level.
